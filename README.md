# 🏠 PropFi – Fractional Real Estate Ownership on Solana

PropFi is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to tokenize real estate assets and invest in fractional property ownership — using the speed, security, and scalability of the Solana blockchain.

## 🌍 Why PropFi?

Real estate is traditionally expensive, paperwork-heavy, and limited to your local area. PropFi changes that by allowing:

- 📦 Tokenization of real-world properties
- 🌐 Global access to property investments
- 💸 Earning simulated rent based on token holdings
- 🔄 Buying and selling fractional property shares with ease

Whether you're in Nigeria, Dubai, New York, or anywhere else — you can invest in real estate just like sending an email.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Property is tokenized** into digital shares.
2. **Users buy tokens** representing a share of the property.
3. **Simulated rent** is distributed based on holdings.
4. **Tokens can be traded** freely within the platform.

All powered by Solana’s lightning-fast blockchain.

## 📊 KPI Goal

**Success Metric:**  
- $10,000+ total value locked (TVL)  
- 100+ unique users  
…within the first 30 days after launch.
